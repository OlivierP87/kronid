kronid
======

Kronecker product of a matrix A and identity matrix 

A C/Matlab code and interface to compute:
- the Kronecker product of a (double) matrix A with identity
- the Kronecker product of Identity with a (double) matrix
- the symmetric Kronecker Product

Use the Makefile to compile the C code, then in Matlab, the mex-interface are generated using program make.m

testall.m : to run all the generated mex files
